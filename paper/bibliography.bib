	abstract = {In previous work we have presented, a functional language-oriented programming language with languages as first-class-citizens. Language definitions can be bound to variables, passed to and returned by functions, and can be modified at run-time before being used. programs are compiled and executed in the higher-order logic programming language Î»Prolog. In this paper, we describe our compilation methods, which highlight how the distinctive features of higher-order logic programming are a great fit in implementing a language-oriented programming language.},
