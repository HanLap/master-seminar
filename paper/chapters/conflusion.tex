In this work we presented LANG-N-PLAY a language-oriented programming language developed by M. Cimini \cite{cimini_languages_2018,cimini_lang-n-play_2018,cimini_effectiveness_2020}. We showed LANG-N-PLAY's unique implementation that is realized using higher-order logic programming. Cimini's work shows how higher-order logic programming is a great fit for implementing language-oriented programming languages.
