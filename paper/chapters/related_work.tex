The primary literature for this paper is 'On the Effectiveness of Higher-Order Logic Programming in Language-Oriented Programming.', written by M. Cimini \cite{cimini_effectiveness_2020}. in their work the Author shows how higher-order logic programming is a gread fit for implementing language-oriented programming languages. To this end Cimini presents an implementation of \texttt{LANG-N-PLAY}, written in $\lambda$Prolog. \texttt{LANG-N-PLAY} is a language-oriented programming langugage that was envisioned in \cite{cimini_languages_2018}.
